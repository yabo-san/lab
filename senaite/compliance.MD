# IT admin:

We are compliant up to CMMC 2.0
That's "Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification 2.0"
We are self-assessed (you likely would not need to specify if it's self-assessment or 3rd party (C3PAO) when name-dropping this, but just fyi)
We are also compliant with DFARS, which is part of CMMC (CMMC contains all DFARS controls), but you could still name both, nobody would bat an eye
That's "Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement"
We are also compliant with NIST SP 800-171 (National Institute of Standards and Technology), which contains controls aimed at achieving DFARS status (which, again, is part of CMMC)
We also do ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) work, which means we are allowed to handle some sensitive documents relating to DoD stuff
